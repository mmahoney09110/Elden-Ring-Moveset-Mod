# Soul Weapons
Take up arms with 9 new weapons infused with the soul of long forgotten warriors. These weapons are powerful on their own but when two handed you tranform into the weapons previous users taking on the skill and power of these mighty souls, however, the cost to your body and mind will be great. All weapons available at Kale.

New to Files in 1.3.1(WIP)
I've added a new transformation. A ritual dagger once carried by an exile of the Eternal City, its blade whispers with the echoes of lost souls.  Transforming turns you into a necromancer bow man and releases these trapped souls.
Added to the UI to track transformation health.
NOTE: This version is still a WIP but as its been so long since my last update and I feel I just keep tweaking and changing stuff I feel I should release it just to get it out there and it may also help me find and work out the kinks. If anything seems off please make a bug report and I will fix it ASAP.

How Transformations Work
- Two handing your weapon will enter transformation. One handing or unequipping will exit it.
 - You and transformations have separate HP
- Transformation HP heals passively while not using them.
- Cannot use flasks during transformation.
- Dying in transformation form will set transformation HP to 1% stun you and take a small amount of HP and FP off your base form.
- Resting fully heals transformations.

Updated for 1.16
I've updated the mod for the latest patch of Elden Ring. If you notice any bugs drop them in the bugs tab and I will try and get to them as quickly as possible. As always thanks for checking my mod out and I hope you enjoy!

Weapons
Each weapon has distinct move sets and designs that gives you a unique look after transformation when two handing. 

Infernon's Soulsword: A cursed ultra greatsword possessed by an ancient warrior and warden of fire. When two handed become this soul and bend fire to your will. All actions will cause flame to burst forth to slaughter your enemies. 

Ramiel's Soulsword: A refined unique sword possessed by an ancient master swordsman and lightning specialist. When two handed become this soul which caused unfocused lightning strikes around you. Attacking hones the lightning in the direction of your strike. Has a special block that has an R1 and R2 counter.

Lucinda's Ring: A ring that can be used as a sorcery catalyst possessed by an ancient mage. When two handed become this soul who is able to cast long chains of magic with R1 or cast close quarter magic with rolling, running, or R2 attacks. Blocking casts stars of ruin as long as you stand still.

Agnar's Greataxe: A greataxe humming with gravitational energy. This weapon is possessed by an ancient champion of gravitational attacks. When two handed become this soul and wield the very earth beneath you. Most actions will cause manipulation to gravity in some way.

Fuadar's Spear: A spear that seems to be linked to an unnatural source. Possessed by an ancient lord long forgotten by time. When two handed become this soul and wield the power fitting of a frenzy lord. Most actions will cause frenzy's flame to burst forth.

Darius's Hammer: A hammer blessed with the light of the heavens. Possessed by an ancient fallen paladin forgotten by time. When two handed become this soul and wield heavens light. Most actions will cause light to attack your foes and has innate HP regeneration.

Doloras's Scythe: A scythe for reaping souls, possessed by an incarnate of death. When two handing become this reaper of souls and wield aspects of death such as ice, black flame, and thorns. Left weapon inflicts ice damage while right weapon inflicts black flame damage.

Phoenix's Spine: A piece of an ancient God,  possessed by an ancient God long forgotten by time. Two handing allows you to take on a dark and twisted manifestation of the Phoenix. Most attacks are empowered by the flame of the Phoenix. This transformation also undergoes a temporary rebirth and is empowered for a time upon its death.

Mortis's Dagger and Bow: A resurrected box and resurrecting dagger. Two handing allows you to embody this necromancer who fights with his bow from afar while his summoned army fights on the frontlines. The amount of spirit resurrected corresponds to you FP.

Unique Skills
Each weapon has a unique skill that only reaches full power when two handing.

Infernon’s Pyric Oath: The lingering will of Infernon, a spirit who sought dominion over all flame, smolders within this strike. In his hubris, he sought to command fire itself—but the inferno he wished to master instead devoured him. Now, his unfulfilled ambition ignites once more, unleashing a searing wrath that cares not for master or foe, only for the eternal hunger of the flame.

Ramiel’s Wrath: The name of Ramiel, once a master of both sword and storm, echoes in this deadly strike. A knight who sought to command the very lightning of the ancient dragons, he was consumed by the power he wielded. His ambition led him down a path of ruin, as the storm he sought to master turned upon him, leaving nothing but regret. Now, his tragic fate manifests as a strike of divine fury, a devastating lightning born of his own fall.

Lucinda’s Unfinished Dream: The sorrow of Lucinda, a scholar of the Primeval Current, lingers within this arcane strike. Though she glimpsed the wisdom of the stars, death claimed her before she could grasp its full breadth. Yet even in passing, her yearning endures—coalescing into a sorcery unfinished, a fragment of the cosmos itself, longing for the mastery she was forever denied.

Agnar’s Descent: The name of Agnar, a warrior renowned for his mastery over the forces of gravity, lingers in this sorrowful strike. Though his skill with the weight of the world was unmatched, his fall from a great height was his undoing. In the end, it is a fate shared by many—great warriors consumed by their own strength. Now, the gravity he once controlled twists into an attack, a reflection of his final, tragic descent.

Fuadar’s Reckoning: The name of Fuadar, once a would-be lord of Frenzy, echoes through this chaotic burst. Entranced by the maddening songs of the Flame of Frenzy, he sought dominion over its power. But the flame consumed him, twisting his will into a slave of its fury. Now, his regrets burn in a frenzied attack, a fleeting glimpse of the power he could never control, spiraling into madness as he once did.

Vengeance of Darius: The lingering wrath of Darius, once a valiant knight of the Golden Order, is woven into this strike. Betrayed by his comrades after the Shattering, his blessed hammer was nearly stolen—but neither death nor treachery could sever his bond to the light. Those who dare to challenge his memory shall be met with a radiant reckoning, as the very heavens answer his unyielding call.

Dirge of Doloras: The echoes of Doloras, an ancient spirit lost to the ages, linger within this cursed blade. A wailing lament rings forth, a desperate cry for lost souls. Those who reap enough life with the scythe before unleashing its dirge will see the spirit’s hunger manifest—death blight seeping into the land, birthing thorns of the withered and damned. A song of sorrow, sung only for the dead.

Spurn of Rebirth A forsaken rite, born from the echoes of an ancient god once known as Phoenix. Though its name is all that lingers, its flame persists—warped, darkened, yet eerily resplendent. Those who embrace this transformation undergo a fleeting rebirth, their strength ignited in death’s grasp. For a time, the fire does not fade, but rages against oblivion—until the embers, too, are claimed by the Lands Between.

Covenant of the Phantom Blade: A ritual dagger once carried by an exile of the Eternal City, its blade whispers with the echoes of lost souls. The more FP gathered, the more phantoms summoned when the wielder enters transformation. 50 FP is consumed per tier (up to tier 4), calling forth spectral warriors whose strength grows with their master, reaching their peak at level 200. Those who wield excess FP may offer 50 FP to the bowman’s final act—a devastating shot, said to mirror the exile’s desperate last stand

How to get/Install
All new weapons available at merchant Kale.

To install you must have modengine2. After installing that simply drop my "SoulWeapon" folder and config file into the modengine2 main folder.
Optional UI: If you wish to use the new UI simply run EldenOverview.exe this will automatically run the UI and modengine2
Note: Put my files in the main modengine2 folder not in the "mod" folder. My folder should be in the same place as "launchmod_eldenring.bat".
Uninstall: Delete "SoulWeapon" folder and edit config_eldenring.toml to make (external_dlls = [ ]) so delete what is in external _dlls and then scroll down to (mods = [{ enabled = true, name = "SoulWeapon", path = "SoulWeapon" }]) and replace "SoulWeapon" with mod. Alternatively, you can just replace my config file with the base one that come with downloading modengine2.

Known Issues and Notes
- This is for my mod version 1.2.10. Due to not as many taking an interest in the merge as well as it over doubling how long it takes me to make changes to my mod I will no longer be updating the merge version. I don't have a lot of time to work on this mod so when I do get time I'd like to spend it make new stuff rather than meticulously going through each file to get my mod to fit with another. I will of course leave the merge I've already done up for anyone wishing to try it. 
- Had to remove Transmog mod as it directly conflicted with transformations. Still text option for it at grace but it does not do anything.
- The Convergence mod is still a mod and after the recent DLC so there are likely bugs. I am not the creator of the mods so I can not help with that, however, if my weapons are not working please drop a comment or report it in bug report tab.
- All weapons still available at kale.
- I am not one of the creators of the convergence mod nor is any of their work mine so consider heading to their mod page and endorse/support them!
