# Soul Weapons
Take up arms with 8 new weapons infused with the soul of long forgotten warriors. These weapons are powerful on their own but when two handed you tranform into the weapons previous users taking on the skill and power of these mighty souls, however, the cost to your body and mind will be great. All weapons available at Kale.
New to Files in 1.2.9
I've added a new transformation. From the spine of an old and ancient God, this spirit can manifest itself through this weapon and allow you to embody the Phoenix.
Convergence merge is now updated to most recent version 2.1.1 that now works with Seemless Coop.

How Transformations Work
- Two handing your weapon will enter transformation. One handing will exit it.
 - You and transformations have separate HPs
- Dying in transformation will revert you to your base form as well as inflicting HP/FP loss and stunning you for a moment.
- Transormation HP heals passively while not using them.
- Cannot use flasks during transformation.
- Dying in transformation form will set transformation HP to 1% stun you and take a small amount of HP and FP off your base form.
- Resting fully heals transformations.

Updated for 1.16

Spurn of Frenzy: Remembering just the name of the ancient spirit, Fuadar, you can draw out his regrets in the form of an attack. A would be lord of frenzy fell victim to the songs of the flame of frenzy. Eventually, the flame would take him, turning him into no lord, but a mere slave.

Doing enough damage with the scythe before hand will empower this skill, infilct death blight, and send out death thorns.

Spurn of Rebirth: Remembering just the name of an ancient God, Phoenix, you can draw out its regrets in the form of an attack.
